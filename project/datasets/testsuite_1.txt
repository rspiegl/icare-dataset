chess identity: count number of pawns in column/row/diagonal
chess symmetry: check symmetry line after another if same amount of pawns in each row (perpendicular to line)
                hard to distinguish pawns in some rotated images (check by reference of top of pawn [circle])

svrt: hard because of scaling and pixel (aliasing), sometimes they don't look perfectly alike, else the rules are clear

psvrt: pretty easy
